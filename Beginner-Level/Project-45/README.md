## **🚀 Installation & Usage**

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jiban0507/Simple-Calculator.git
cd Simple-Calculator
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser

3. Use the calculator by clicking the buttons to input numbers and operations

## **🔧 How it Works**

* **Numbers** are appended to the display when clicked
* **Operators** (`+ - * /`) are handled intelligently to avoid invalid expressions
* **Clear (`C`)** resets the display
* **Delete (`DEL`)** removes the last character
* **Calculate (`=`)** evaluates the expression using JavaScript’s `eval()` method

## **🚀 Future Enhancements**

* Add **keyboard support** for input
* Add **percentage (%)** and **square root** functions
* Improve **error handling** for division by zero
* Add **dark/light theme toggle**
* Add **history of previous calculations**
