## How to Choose a Project to Contribute

### For New Contributors

1. **Browse the Issues**: Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `beginner-friendly`
2. **Check the Project List**: Review our project categories (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, etc.) and pick one that matches your skill level
3. **Read Existing Projects**: Examine completed projects to understand our structure and quality expectations

### Project Categories

- **Beginner**: HTML/CSS layouts, simple JavaScript interactions
- **Intermediate**: API integrations, local storage, form validation
- **Advanced**: Complex state management, performance optimization, accessibility features

### Before You Start

- Check if someone is already working on the project by looking at open pull requests
- Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it
- Ask questions if the requirements aren't clear

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git installed on your machine
- A GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Fork and Clone the Repository

1. **Fork the repository**
   - Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page
   - This creates a copy of the repo in your GitHub account

2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/code-odyssey.git
   cd code-odyssey
   ```

3. **Add the original repository as upstream**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/code-odyssey.git
   ```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a New Branch

Always create a new branch for your contribution:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/project-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- `feature/calculator-app` - for new projects
- `fix/responsive-layout` - for bug fixes
- `docs/update-readme` - for documentation updates

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Create your project in the appropriate directory structure:
  ```
  projects/
  â”œâ”€â”€ beginner/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ your-project-name/
  â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
  â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ style.css
  â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ script.js
  â”‚       â””â”€â”€ README.md
  ```

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: Calculator app with basic arithmetic operations"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
- `Add:` for new features/projects
- `Fix:` for bug fixes
- `Update:` for improvements to existing code
- `Docs:` for documentation changes

### 4. Keep Your Branch Updated

Before pushing, sync with the main repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

### 5. Push Your Changes

```bash
git push origin feature/your-branch-name
```

### 6. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Click "New Pull Request"
3. Select your branch and the main repository's `main` branch
4. Fill out the PR template with:
   - Clear description of what you've built
   - Screenshots or GIFs (if applicable)
   - Any special instructions for testing

## Code Style Guidelines

### HTML
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper meta tags and accessibility attributes
- Indent with 2 spaces
- Use lowercase for all HTML elements and attributes

### CSS
- Use consistent naming conventions (kebab-case recommended)
- Organize CSS logically (layout â†’ typography â†’ colors â†’ components)
- Include responsive design considerations
- Use CSS custom properties for reusable values

### JavaScript
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Include comments for complex logic
- Follow ES6+ standards where appropriate
- Handle errors gracefully

### File Structure
Each project should include:
- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `style.css` - CSS styles
- `script.js` - JavaScript functionality
- `README.md` - Project description, features, and setup instructions

## Testing Guidelines

### Before Submitting
- Test your project in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
- Check for console errors
- Validate HTML and CSS using online validators
- Test all interactive features

### Accessibility
- Ensure proper contrast ratios
- Include alt text for images
- Test keyboard navigation
- Use ARIA labels where appropriate

## Reporting Issues

### Before Creating an Issue

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Check if the issue exists in the latest version
3. Try to reproduce the issue consistently

### Creating a Good Issue Report

Use our issue templates and include:

- **Clear title**: Describe the issue in one line
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the problem
- **Steps to reproduce**: List the exact steps
- **Expected behavior**: What should happen
- **Actual behavior**: What actually happens
- **Screenshots**: If applicable
- **Environment**: Browser, OS, screen size

### Issue Labels

- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature request
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention needed

## Communication Etiquette

### General Guidelines

- **Be respectful**: Treat all contributors with kindness and respect
- **Be patient**: Remember that everyone is learning
- **Be constructive**: Provide helpful feedback and suggestions
- **Be inclusive**: Welcome contributors of all backgrounds and skill levels

### In Issues and Pull Requests

- Use clear, descriptive language
- Stay on topic and relevant to the discussion
- Provide context when asking questions
- Thank contributors for their time and effort
- If disagreeing, focus on the code/idea, not the person

### Code Reviews

- Focus on the code, not the coder
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Acknowledge good practices when you see them
- Be specific with feedback
- Suggest improvements rather than just pointing out problems

### Getting Help

- Check existing documentation first
- Search closed issues and pull requests
- Ask specific questions with relevant context
